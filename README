This program takes 360 server/SSC logs and merges them so that they are in order chronologically. 
To manually build: 

gcc mergeLogs.c -o MergeLogs

Or, this includes a simple makefile. 

To run: 
./MergeLogs
The summary will show you how to run ;)

Known bugs: 

--if the logs being merged contain Null characters '\0', then these will only be read up until this point instead of upto the end of the line. This is uncommon but possible to occur in the logs prior to merging.
